# Star Wars Fanbase

## 📖About Project
It was the major project for my Advanced Java class. It is a Wikipedia-like page about Star Wars, where users can search for information about the universe or films and create accounts to add their favorite character, 
planet, and film. The project uses the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.py4e.com/) as a data source. It is a multimodule project where each module is a separate Spring Boot application to meet the project requirements.

Currently, users can browse data about characters, planets, and films in the Star Wars universe. There is also the option to register an account and add favorite characters, planets, and films.

**Regrettably, I was unable to complete the project fully due to misleading deadline information and other classes. However, I plan to complete this project in the future.**
